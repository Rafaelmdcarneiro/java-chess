play Bb5, so e6 was aimed at discouraging this move.} 5. g3 Ne7 6. Bg2 Nbc6 7.

Diagram [#]} Rac8 (13... Rae8 {, controling the open e-file with possible
pressure on the queen later, was a better square for the rook.}) 14. c3 Rfe8

Diagram [#] Although black's pawns are on the right color while white's are
not, as long as black can't penetrate white's position, the game should end in
the draw. We were both in time pressure here, and Anupama eventually allowed
the black bishop to get the c1, after which black is winning.} 0-1
